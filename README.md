# E-commerce Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data using SQL to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and key sales trends. It involves designing a structured database, writing queries to extract meaningful insights, and visualizing trends over time.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle:  
[Unlock Profits with E-Commerce Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data)

## Database Schema
The project consists of the following tables:

- *Customers*: Stores customer details such as name, email, location, and signup date.
- *Products*: Contains product information including name, category, price, and stock quantity.
- *Orders*: Tracks orders placed by customers, along with order dates and total amounts.
- *Transactions*: Manages payment details including method, status, and amount.

## Key SQL Queries
The following SQL queries help extract important insights:

1. *Total Sales Calculation*
   sql
   SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales FROM Transactions WHERE PaymentStatus = 'Completed';
   

2. *Average Order Value*
   sql
   SELECT AVG(TotalAmount) AS AverageOrderValue FROM Orders;
   

3. *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)*
   sql
   SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS CustomerLifetimeValue
   FROM Orders
   GROUP BY CustomerID
   ORDER BY CustomerLifetimeValue DESC;
   

4. *Best-Selling Products*
   sql
   SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(o.TotalAmount) AS TotalRevenue
   FROM Orders o
   JOIN Products p ON o.OrderID = p.ProductID
   GROUP BY p.ProductName
   ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   

5. *Sales Trends Over Time*
   sql
   SELECT OrderDate, SUM(TotalAmount) AS DailySales
   FROM Orders
   GROUP BY OrderDate
   ORDER BY OrderDate;
   

## How to Use
1. *Download the dataset* from Kaggle and import it into your database.
2. *Run the SQL scripts* provided in this project to create tables and analyze data.
3. *Modify and expand* queries based on your specific analytical needs.

## Future Enhancements
- *Data Visualization*: Use Python libraries like Matplotlib or Tableau to visualize trends.
- *Performance Optimization*: Implement indexing and query optimization techniques.
- *Additional KPIs*: Include metrics like repeat purchase rate and customer segmentation.
